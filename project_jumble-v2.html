          During my time at EOI Foundation's accelerator program, I co-led the project taking on an ambitious challenge: reinventing how remote development teams collaborate. We had 6 weeks to validate, build, and launch a solution that would make a real difference in how teams work together.

            <strong>Timeline:</strong> 6 weeks </br>
            <strong>Team:</strong> 1 developer, 1 product designer</br>
            <strong>Role:</strong> Product Design, Frontend, User Research, UX/UI, Branding</span></br>

          <strong>Problem:</strong> remote work is changing how development teams collaborate, and not always for the better. While tools for video calls and code sharing were abundant, teams were struggling with something more fundamental, <strong> the spontaneous knowledge sharing that happens in an office.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-black">
          A tech lead at a 200-person startup captured it perfectly:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Most of our knowledge sharing happens by accident - when someone overhears a problem being discussed. We've lost that in remote work."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-black">
          Through early conversations with teams, we identified several critical issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge was becoming siloed in individual team members</li>
          <li>Junior developers were missing key learning opportunities</li>
          <li>Teams spent too much time coordinating across time zones</li>
          <li>The spontaneous "tap on the shoulder" for help was gone</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-black pb-5">
          <strong>Goal:</strong> make remote pair programming as natural as turning to a colleague in the office. We wanted to eliminate the friction in finding help while preserving teams' existing workflows and tools.

        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-black">
          Through user interviews, we discovered teams weren't struggling with the actual pair programming—they were struggling with everything around it:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Finding the right person to pair with is often harder than solving the actual coding problem." - Senior Engineer at a 200-person startup
        </blockquote>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-black">
          Our research also revealed that some remote development teams were struggling to maintain collaborative coding practices. Through user interviews and market analysis, we identified that while teams valued pair programming, the logistics of organizing sessions remotely was a significant barrier to adoption.

          The vision was to create a community to engage with other developers and solve problems better, and to find each other not because of geographical proximity but because they are the right people in the right place. Jumble lets you host sessions to collaborate live with other developers in a project you have, and participate in sessions hosted by other developers to collaborate and contribute.

          During this period, we worked hard to transform a basic idea into a fully functional MVP that we're proud of. We developed detailed business plans and had in-depth conversations with potential customers. We were flexible enough to pivot when necessary, trying out different approaches to tackle the problem. This whole accelerator process wasn't just about creating a product; it was about refining our skills and learning from every step.
